## Features

- Customizable messages, reactions, command, and roles

- Auto-removes role when user removes a reaction

- Option to use an embed to have all options in one message

- Error handling to let you know if something is wrong

## Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine.

Run the `npm install` command to install discord.js

Copy the `config.example.js` file and rename it to `config.js`. Open that file and modify the different properties to your liking. Most options are straightforward, however, there is commenting where approriate

## Recommended Permissions

These are the recommended permissions the bot should be assigned for full functionality. Errors will be thrown if the bot fails to have any of the permissions below.

- Manage Roles
- Read Text Channels & See Voice Channels
- Send Messages
- Manage Messages
- Embed Links
- Read Message History
- Add Reactions

## Configuration
Mandatory:

- Fill in the `yourID` property with your User ID. You can get your User ID in any Discord channel by typing `\@YOUR NAME` or enabling "Developer Mode" in the Appearance section of your Discord settings and right clicking your username and click "Copy ID". For example, you would do `\@anthony` to get [acollierr17](https://github.com/acollierr17)'s Discord User ID

- Change roles the to ones that are in your server

- Replace the reaction emojis with the ones of your choosing. 
**Note:** to get the value for the reaction, type `\:my_reaction:` with the backslash and press enter. If done correctly, a smaller emoji should appear. Copy the small emoji into the reactions array. For custom emojis, simply provide the name of the custom emoji that you wish to use

- Set the `embed` property to true or false if you wish to use a single embed for all reaction roles. After that, set the text for the embed footer via the `embedFooter` property

- Set up the bot and get a token. The [Github Wiki Page](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/wiki/Creating-a-discord-bot-&-getting-a-token) explains how to set up bots and get tokens. An image of the permissions the bot needs can be [found here](https://i.imgur.com/PFDm3pH.png). **Make sure the bot has a role with the permissions that allows it to modify another user's roles and its role is above the set roles**

Optional:

- Modify the `setupCMD` property to display a custom setup message

- Modify `initialMessage` property to display a custom initial message

- Modify the `embedMessage` property to display a custom message for the embed

- Modify the `embedColor` property to display a custom embed color

- Modify the `setupCMD` property to a custom command to be used

- Modify the `deleteSetupCMD` property to delete the `setupCMD` message when it's ran

**After you have installed discord.js and made the modifications above, run the `npm start` command to start the bot!**
